    /*
     变量作用域 scope 和作用域链 scope chain

     JavaScript has two scopes: global and local.
     A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program.
     A variable that is declared inside a function definition is local.
     It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function.
     JavaScript does not support block scope (in which a set of braces {. . .} defines a new scope), except in the special case of block-scoped variables.
